In this folder all unit-tests should be placed. I would recommend to use pytest fot this.
I you decide to do unit-testing try to keep on a unit level testing and not on a software level testing, because software level is hard to maintain in an fast changing project.
To write nice unit tests, i would recommend to do some tutorials, use the conftest.py file, mocks and patches.
